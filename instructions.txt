Hello! If you want to try the SymMat class out, download
my repository and execute the main.exe file. It will
kind of guide you through what the class can do using the 
terminal. 

The debug.exe file contains most of the operations that
the class can perform. I used it to try everything out
and decided do let it stay here as  someone might want to use it,
but it is not intended to be used!

If you want to compile the files, you can use the included Makefile.
Open the terminal in the folder that contains all the files and execute
	$make
Which will create the executables from the main.cc and debug.cc
Or use
	$make clean
to delete both executables.

(make essentially does this:
	$g++ main.cc -o main.exe -std=c++11
	$g++ debug.cc -o debug.exe -std=c++11
so you can use these commands to manually compile everything)



To use the class in a program, just add 
	$#include "symMat.hh"
to your code (Do not put the dollar sign). 

Take into accound that if you have Eigen installed,
instead of copying the Eigen folder to your program's
directory you may change the 
	$#include "Eigen/Dense"
	$#include "Eigen/Core" 
to
	$#include <Eigen/Dense>
	$#include <Eigen/Core>

Thank you for reading this. I hope it is useful!
